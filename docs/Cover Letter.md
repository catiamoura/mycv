I've always stood out for being a multipotential person with interests from music, to health, to technology. New experiences and knowledge is something that moves me as a professional.

My professional path has been traced in the health area, as a Speech and Language Therapist, where I have the opportunity to strengthen my knowledge and practice in language, speech, communication, voice technic, and others.
I acknowledge that this career has provided me tools that are present in everything I do, even if not  directly related to Speech and Language Therapy.
Team work, project leading, team leading, communicate with all types of people, of the most diverse ages, time management, are some of the many skills I acquired.
Throughout my professional experience i learnt to be empathic, methodic, organized, responsible, autonomous and focused. I also deal in a daily basis with tools like MS Office, especially with Excel.

Despite having good professional experiences, as i mencioned above, the IT area is a passion that's in my life since always for being surrounded with family members who work in the area.
I've been feeling the need to drastically change my professional path and for that reason i've been investing my free time in education and knowledge at this level. I am currently attending a  certification in Data Analysis - Power BI, to expand my knowledge in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. This is not the only area i want to learn, i'm also interested in Python and JavaScript for instance.

I'm looking for an opportunity to integrate the professional world in the IT area so that I can have quality training and start my professional experience.
